- p1-p16

## Units

- Potential/Tension/Volts (V, U): Concentration of charges.
- Current/Amperage/Intensity (A, I): The intensity of the electric current in relation to the charge per second.
- Resistance/Ohm ($\Omega$, R): Material's ability to resist the passage of current.
- Power/Watt (W, P): Link between A and I.
- Charge/Coulomb (Q): Electric charge.
- Potential difference (E): Difference in potential between two ends.

## Laws

### Potential Difference in a Battery

- $U_{PN} = V_P - V_N$

- $U_{PN}$ = Potential difference (E)
- $V_P$ = Lack of electrons
- $V_N$ = Excess of electrons

> VPN => VP - VN

### Voltage / Power / Charge

- $U = W / Q$

### Ampere / Charge / Time

- $I = Q / t$
- $t$ = time in seconds

### Resistance of a Wire

- $R = \cfrac{raw \times l}{S}$
- $raw$ = Resistance coefficient of a material
- $l$ = length of the wire
- $S$ = surface area of the wire

### Mathiessen

- $R_T = R_0 \times (1+a \times T)$
- $R_T$ = Resistance in relation to temperature
- $R_0$ = Original resistance
- $a$ = Temperature coefficient of a material
- $T$ = Temperature

### Ohm's Law

- $U = R \times I$

### Power Law

- $P = U \times I$

### Joule Effect

- Applies if the receiver is purely calorific
- $W_{cal} = R \times I^2 \times t$
- $t$ = time in seconds
