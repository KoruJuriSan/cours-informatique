### What to study

- Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal, Decimal (positive) conversion
- Data transfer rate in computing
- Latency
- CPU: definition, purpose, CPU components (utility of each), CPU selection, composition, BIG.little architecture (mini-CPU), fabrication process, CPU frequency, overclocking, undervolting, TDP (elements of the formula, not the formula itself - what does it represent?), types of parallelism, CPU FLOPS.
- Mention cooling methods
- Purpose of the pipeline
- Hyperthreading definition
- CPU instruction sets (x86, ARM, ...)
- Synthetic vs. application benchmarks
- DRAM vs. SRAM, RAM refresh rate (capacitor), RAM characteristics, Latency formula, RAM selection criteria
- Why is it called Double Rate Data DDR
- ECC memory definition
- Multi-channel RAM (types, sizes)

#### Chapter 4
- HDD vs. SSD, SSHD
- How does an HDD work, speed calculation, sizes (in inches), characteristics directly influencing HDD data rates, half vs. full duplex HDD (read/write simultaneously?), HDD access time calculations (RPM, time/cycles), fragmentation, defragmentation, definition of IOPS, data erasure on an HDD (not total)
- SSD characteristics, NAND types for SSD (names, ranking from best to worst), what is an SSD
- SSD vs. HDD (know at least 4-6 points)
- RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5
- RAID types (software, hardware, pseudo-hardware)

#### Chapter 5
- Briefly, what is a motherboard, what is the BIOS for, where is the BIOS stored, what is the chipset, what are VRMs, formats/sizes (ATX, ...), the first **3** criteria for choosing a motherboard.
- What does the power supply do, formulas for choosing power in watts (TDP calculation), at least an 80 Plus Gold power supply, power supply modularity, power supply selection
- What is the GPU for (graphics/scientific), integrated or not in the CPU, soldered or not to the motherboard, GPU diagram, selection criteria (gaming, scientific calculations - criteria in order), Stream processors == the most important, FLOP calculations (scientific and gaming), GPU bandwidth + calculation, TDP/TGP/... (GPU power consumption), connectors (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI).
- Cases, case ventilation
- Screens: what is the screen size vs. definition vs. resolution, HD vs. FullHD vs. ... vs. 8K, Brightness, contrast ratio, panel type. Know OLED vs. LCD, screen selection (page-36).

- Heat pipe cooling, vapor chamber
- How the pipeline works
- DDR operation
- RAM timing, except latency
- Cooling of RAM
- Variable HDD speed
- SSD filling
