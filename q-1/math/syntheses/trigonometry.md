# Trigonometry

## Units

Angles:
- Degrees: 360°, the complete angle of a circle.
- Radian: 1$\pi$ radian == 180°

## rules

### bases

- $cos^2x$ == $(cos(x))^2$

- $cos^2\alpha + sin^2\alpha = 1$

- $tan^2 \alpha +1 == 1 / cos^2\alpha$

- $1 + cot^2\alpha == 1/sin^2\alpha$

### addition

- $cos(a+b) == cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)$

- $cos(a-b) == cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)$

- $sin(a+b) == sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)+sin(b)$

- $sin(a-b) == sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)+sin(b)$

- $tan(a+b) == \frac{tan(a) + tan(b)}{1 - tan(a) tan(b)}$

- $tan(a-b) == \frac{tan(a) - tan(b)}{1 - tan(a) tan(b)}$

### duplication

- $sin(2\alpha) == 2sin(a)cos(a)$

- $cos(2\alpha) == cos^2(\alpha) - sin^2(\alpha)$

- $tan(2a) == \frac{2 \times tan(a)}{1-tan^2{a}}$

### Carnot

- $1+cos(a) == 2cos^2(a/2)$

- $1+cos(2a) == 2cos^2(a)$

- $1-cos(a) == 2sin^2(a/2)$

- $1-cos(2a) == 2sin^2(a)$ 

### Simpson

- $sin(p) + sin(q) == 2sin(p+q/2) cos(p-q/2)$

- $sin(p) - sin(q) == 2sin(p-q/2) cos(p+q/2)$

- $cos(p) + cos(q) == 2cos(p+q/2) cos(p-q/2)$

- $cos(p) - cos(q) == -2sin(p+q/2) sin(p-q/2)$

- $tan(p) + tan(q) == \frac{sin(p+q)}{cos(p)cos(q)}$

- $tan(p) - tan(q) == \frac{sin(p-q)}{cos(p)cos(q)}$

### tangent of a/2

- $sin(a) == \frac{2tan(a/2)}{1+tan^2(a/2)}$

- $cos(a) == \frac{1 - tan^2(a/2)}{ 1 + tan^2(a/2)}$

## Trigonometry equations

## 1st degree
- The goal of a trigonometric equation is to find an infinite set of solutions in $\pi rd$ on the trigonometric circle ($S=(x=... \times k\pi, x = ...; k \in \Z)$ )

- cos x = y has at least two solutions because cos x can be in both the I and IV or II and III quadrants, the same goes for sin in the I and II or III and IV quadrants.

> If you have roots x and you need to use square roots to solve the equation, you will need to calculate solutions for $\sqrt{...}$ and $-\sqrt{...}$

### 2nd degree
- To solve a 2nd-degree equation, you need to set the value of cos/sin/tan x in a temporary variable, such as y = sin x, for example.

## Trigonometry functions
-

### sin
- Starts at 1, descends to -1 over a distance of $\pi$ and rises back to 1 over a distance of $\pi$, repeats this interval infinitely.

> Do not confuse with cosine, which starts at 0 |!|

- Arc sin is the reciprocal of sin. If $sin(x) = y$, then $arcsin(y) = x$.

### cos
- Starts at 0, rises to 1 over a distance of $\pi/2$, descends to -1 over a distance of $\pi$ and rises back to 1 over a distance of $\pi/2$, repeats this interval infinitely.

> Do not confuse with sine, which starts at 1 |!|

- Arc cos is the reciprocal of cos. If $cos(x) = y$, then $arccos(y) = x$.

### tan
- Gives increasingly larger values as you approach ($\pi/2 + k\pi$) without reaching a value for ($\pi/2 + k\pi$).

### cotangent
- Gives increasingly larger values as you approach ($k\pi, k \in \Z$) without reaching a value for ($k\pi, k \in \Z$).

- Gives 0 for the value 0
